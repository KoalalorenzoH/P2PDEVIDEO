Decentralized Encrypted Peer-to-Peer Video Network


### 1. Project Overview  

"Decentralized Encrypted Peer-to-Peer Video Network" (hereinafter referred to as "DEPPVN") is a decentralized encrypted video distribution and storage system based on peer-to-peer (P2P) and blockchain technologies. It aims to provide users with trustless intermediary-free, secure, private, and scalable online video hosting and real-time streaming services through end-to-end encryption and a distributed node network.  

### 2. Product Goals  

- **Decentralization**: Eliminate single points of failure and centralized storage risks.  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensure the confidentiality of video content during transmission and storage, with only authorized users able to decrypt and view it.  
- **High Availability & Reliability**: Guarantee service availability and data durability through a distributed node network.  
- **Scalability**: Support massive video files and concurrent streaming requests.  
- **Cost Optimization**: Leverage idle storage and bandwidth resources to reduce operational costs.  

### 3. Core Features

   - Multi-role management (content uploaders, viewers, node hosts)  
   - Support for verified and anonymous modes to ensure privacy and compliance  
   - User profiling and recommendation systems  
   - Parental controls and content rating management  

2. **Video Upload & Management**  
   - Upload encryption: Client-side end-to-end encryption (AES-256)  
   - Chunking: Automatic parallel encryption of video slices to improve upload efficiency  
   - Metadata registration: Record video hashes, access permissions, and encryption key fingerprints via smart contracts  
   - Content digest generation (SHA-256) and deduplication detection  
   - Video tagging, categorization, search, and intelligent recommendations  
   - Multi-language subtitles and automatic transcription  

3. **Distributed Storage**  
   - Decentralized storage based on IPFS/Filecoin  
   - Chunk storage with multi-copy redundancy and dynamic replica adjustment  
   - Node reputation system: Credit scoring, penalty mechanisms, and malicious node prevention  
   - Storage resource trading market, allowing nodes to bid and compete  
   - Remote backup and disaster recovery mechanisms  

4. **Encryption Key Management**  
   - Use of KMS or decentralized key management (Threshold Encryption)  
   - Private key sharding storage and threshold reconstruction  
   - Support for Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to enhance key operation security  
   - Key rotation and access log auditing  

5. **Streaming Distribution**  
   - End-to-end encrypted real-time transmission via WebRTC/SRT  
   - P2P CDN acceleration with optimal routing and load balancing  
   - Adaptive bitrate switching (HLS/DASH)  
   - Offline download and playback of encrypted content  
   - Real-time bullet comments, interactive features, and distributed chat rooms  
   - Cross-platform SDKs (iOS/Android/Web) and third-party player integration  

6. **Smart Contracts & Token Incentives**  
   - Smart contract deployment (Solidity / Rust)  
   - Node resource contribution measurement and token settlement  
   - Pay-per-access and subscription mechanisms  
   - Token holder incentives: Dividends for platform value growth  
   - Community governance: DAO voting for platform upgrades and parameter adjustments  
   - Ad and sponsor integration  

7. **Content Security & Copyright Protection**  
   - DRM support and watermarking technology  
   - AI-powered moderation: Detection of violence, explicit content, and copyright infringement  
   - On-chain copyright information and licensing agreements  
   - Appeal and arbitration processes  
   - Compliance reporting and regional access control  

8. **Monitoring & Operations**  
   - Network health monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)  
   - Log aggregation (ELK Stack)  
   - Security audits and alerts  
   - SLA monitoring and report generation  
   - Automated operations and self-healing capabilities  

9. **Data Analytics & Reporting**  
   - Real-time traffic and viewer behavior analysis  
   - Revenue and resource usage reports  
   - BI dashboards and visualization tools  
   - A/B testing and optimization tools  

10. **Developer Support & Extensibility**  
    - Comprehensive open API documentation and SDKs  
    - Plugin and marketplace ecosystem (App Store model)  
    - Localization and multilingual support  
    - Accessibility features
