# Role Management Guide

This guide provides an overview of implementing role management in the P2PDEVIDEO application. Role management is crucial for controlling access to various system features based on user roles. This document outlines the necessary steps, including creating roles, assigning roles to users, and implementing role-based access control (RBAC).

## 1. Overview of Role Management

Role management allows the application to define various roles that users can have, such as admin, user, and guest. Each role will have specific permissions that determine what actions a user can perform within the application.

## 2. Defining Roles

To implement role management, you need to define the roles within the application. This can be done in the `roleModel.js` file located in the `src/models` directory. Here's an example of how to define roles:

```javascript
// src/models/roleModel.js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const roleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true
    },
    permissions: {
        type: [String],
        default: []
    }
});

const Role = mongoose.model('Role', roleSchema);
module.exports = Role;
```

### Example Roles
- **Admin**: Full access to all features, including user management.
- **User**: Limited access to their own profile and video upload features.
- **Guest**: Read-only access to public videos.

## 3. Assigning Roles to Users

You can assign roles to users during the user registration process or update existing users. This can be handled in the `userController.js` file:

```javascript
// src/controllers/userController.js
const User = require('../models/user');
const Role = require('../models/roleModel');

async function registerUser(req, res) {
    try {
        const { username, password, role } = req.body;
        const user = new User({ username, password });
        const assignedRole = await Role.findOne({ name: role });
        user.role = assignedRole._id; // Assign role to user
        await user.save();
        res.status(201).json({ message: 'User registered successfully.' });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({ message: 'Error registering user.' });
    }
}
```

## 4. Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

To enforce role-based access, you can create middleware that checks a user's role before allowing access to specific routes. Implement this middleware in the `userRoleRoutes.js` file:

```javascript
// src/api/userRoleRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const { checkUserRole } = require('../middleware/userValidation');

router.get('/admin', checkUserRole('Admin'), (req, res) => {
    res.send('Welcome Admin!');
});

module.exports = router;
```

### Example Middleware

```javascript
// src/middleware/userValidation.js
const User = require('../models/user');

async function checkUserRole(role) {
    return async (req, res, next) => {
        const user = await User.findById(req.user.id);
        if (user.role.name === role) {
            return next();
        }
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied.' });
    };
}

module.exports = { checkUserRole };
```

## 5. Conclusion

Implementing role management is essential for maintaining security and proper access control in the P2PDEVIDEO application. By following this guide, you will be able to define roles, assign them to users, and enforce access control throughout your application.

For further enhancements, consider implementing features such as dynamic role assignment, advanced permission settings, and user role management interfaces.

## 6. Next Steps
- Review existing routes for necessary role checks.
- Implement unit tests for role management functionalities.
- Develop a user interface for managing roles and permissions.
