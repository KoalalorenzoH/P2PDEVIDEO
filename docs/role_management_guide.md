# Role Management Guide

This guide provides developers with detailed information on implementing role management functionality within the P2PDEVIDEO application. Role management is crucial for controlling user access and permissions throughout the platform.

## Overview
Role management allows administrators to assign different roles to users, granting them specific permissions based on their role. This functionality is essential for maintaining security and ensuring appropriate access controls.

## Key Concepts

1. **Roles**: A role defines a set of permissions. Common roles may include user, admin, and moderator.
2. **Permissions**: Permissions determine what actions a user can perform within the application. For example, an admin may have permissions to modify user roles, while a regular user may only be able to upload and manage their videos.
3. **Role Assignment**: Assigning roles to users can be done during user registration or updated later through profile management.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Define Role Schema
Define a schema for roles in the `src/models/userRole.js` file. This schema should include fields like `roleName`, `permissions`, and any necessary validation rules.

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const userRoleSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
    roleName: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
    permissions: { type: [String], required: true }
});

const UserRole = mongoose.model('UserRole', userRoleSchema);
module.exports = UserRole;
```

### Step 2: Create Role Management API Routes
Implement API routes for managing roles in `src/api/roleManagementRoutes.js`. These routes should include endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting roles as well as assigning roles to users.

### Step 3: Implement Role Management Controller
Create a controller in `src/controllers/userRoleController.js` to handle business logic related to role management. Include methods for assigning roles to users and checking user permissions.

### Step 4: Middleware for Role-Based Access Control
Develop middleware to enforce role-based access control on your routes. This middleware should check a user's role before allowing access to certain endpoints.

```javascript
function roleMiddleware(roles) {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        if (!req.user || !roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
        }
        next();
    };
}

module.exports = roleMiddleware;
```

### Step 5: Testing
Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for the role management functionality. Ensure that all edge cases are covered, such as assigning roles to users and checking permissions.

## Documentation
Maintain clear documentation for the role management functionality in the `docs/user_role_management.md`. Include information on how to use the API, examples of role assignments, and any specific requirements for implementing roles.

## Conclusion
Implementing role management is essential for maintaining a secure and organized platform. By following this guide, developers can effectively manage user roles and permissions, enhancing the overall functionality of the P2PDEVIDEO application.
