# User Profile Management Features

## Overview
User profile management is a crucial feature of the P2PDEVIDEO application, allowing users to create, update, and manage their profiles securely. This document outlines the functionalities, usage, and implementation details of user profile management within the application.

## Features

### 1. Profile Creation
- Users can create a new profile by providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
