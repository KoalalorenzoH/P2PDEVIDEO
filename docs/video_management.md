# Video Management Features Documentation

## Overview
The Video Management feature in P2PDEVIDEO allows users to upload, manage, and retrieve videos within the decentralized network. This functionality is crucial for ensuring that users can easily handle their video content while maintaining security and efficiency.

## Core Features
1. **Video Upload**: Users can upload videos to the platform, which will be encrypted for security purposes.
2. **Metadata Handling**: Each uploaded video will have associated metadata, including title, description, and tags, which aids in search and retrieval.
3. **Content Digest Generation**: A unique content digest will be generated for each video to ensure integrity and authenticity.
4. **Video Management Interface**: Users will have a user-friendly interface to manage their uploaded videos, including options to edit details, delete videos, and view statistics.

## Implementation Details
### Video Upload
- The upload process includes client-side encryption to ensure that videos remain secure during transmission.
- Users must authenticate before being allowed to upload content.

### Metadata Registration
- Metadata for each video will be stored in the database and linked to the video file.
- The metadata will include:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Tags
  - Uploader information

### Content Digest
- A content digest will be generated using SHA-256 to verify the video file's integrity.
- This digest will be stored alongside the video metadata.

### Video Management Interface
- The user interface will allow users to:
  - View a list of their uploaded videos.
  - Edit video details.
  - Delete videos they no longer wish to keep.
  - View statistics such as views and engagement metrics.

## Security Considerations
- All video uploads will be encrypted using AES-256 to prevent unauthorized access.
- A robust authentication mechanism will be in place to verify user identities before allowing uploads.

## Next Steps
- Implement the backend logic for video uploads and management.
- Create unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and security of the video management features.

## Conclusion
The Video Management functionality is a critical component of the P2PDEVIDEO project, enabling users to efficiently manage their video content while ensuring security and integrity. This documentation will be updated as features are implemented and refined.
