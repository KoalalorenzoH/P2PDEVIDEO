# Video Management Integration Tests

This document outlines the integration tests for the Video Management features of the P2PDEVIDEO application. Integration tests ensure that the various components of the video management system work together as expected.

## Overview
The Video Management component is responsible for handling video uploads, management, and retrieval. The integration tests will focus on the following functionalities:
- Uploading videos
- Retrieving video metadata
- Managing video access and permissions

## Testing Framework
We will use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our testing framework along with [Supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest) for HTTP assertions. Ensure that these packages are included in your `package.json`:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.0.0",
    "supertest": "^6.0.0"
}
```

## Test Cases
### 1. Video Upload
- **Description**: Test if users can successfully upload a video.
- **Input**: Video file and metadata.
- **Expected Outcome**: The video should be stored in the database, and a success response should be returned.

### 2. Video Retrieval
- **Description**: Test if users can retrieve video metadata by video ID.
- **Input**: Valid video ID.
- **Expected Outcome**: The metadata for the requested video should be returned.

### 3. Video Access Control
- **Description**: Test if permissions are correctly enforced when accessing videos.
- **Input**: Video ID from various user roles.
- **Expected Outcome**: Users should only be able to access videos they have permission for.

## Running the Tests
To run the integration tests, use the following command:
```bash
npm test
```

Ensure that your development environment is set up correctly, including the database connection and required environment variables.

## Conclusion
The integration tests for the Video Management component are crucial for ensuring the reliability and functionality of video-related features in the P2PDEVIDEO application. Regularly update these tests as new features are added or existing features are modified.
