# Video Management Integration Tests

This document outlines the integration tests for the video management features of the P2PDEVIDEO application. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that the video upload, retrieval, and management functionalities work seamlessly together within the application.

## Overview

The video management features include:
- Uploading videos
- Retrieving video metadata
- Deleting videos
- Updating video information

Integration tests will verify that these functionalities interact correctly with each other and that the overall user experience is maintained.

## Setup Instructions

To run the integration tests for video management, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:
1. Node.js is installed on your machine.
2. MongoDB is running and accessible.
3. The application is set up according to the [setup instructions](./video_management_guide.md).

## Running the Tests

1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following command to execute the integration tests:
   ```bash
   npm test -- tests/integration/videoManagementIntegration_test.js
   ```

## Integration Tests

### Test Cases

1. **Test Video Upload**  
   - **Description**: Verify that a user can upload a video successfully.
   - **Expected Result**: The video should be stored in the database, and metadata should be returned.

2. **Test Video Retrieval**  
   - **Description**: Verify that a user can retrieve video metadata after uploading.
   - **Expected Result**: The metadata should match the uploaded video data.

3. **Test Video Deletion**  
   - **Description**: Verify that a user can delete a video.
   - **Expected Result**: The video should no longer be accessible, and the metadata should be removed from the database.

4. **Test Video Update**  
   - **Description**: Verify that a user can update video information.
   - **Expected Result**: The updated information should reflect in the database when retrieved.

### Logging and Error Handling

Each test case should log relevant information to the console and handle any errors gracefully. Use assertions to verify expected outcomes and capture failures.

## Conclusion

These integration tests are vital in ensuring that the video management features are functioning correctly. Regularly running these tests will help maintain the integrity of the video management system as new features are added or existing ones are modified.
