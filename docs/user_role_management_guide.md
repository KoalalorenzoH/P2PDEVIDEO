# User Role Management Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide on the user role management features of the P2PDEVIDEO application. User role management is critical for ensuring appropriate access control and permissions within the system, allowing for a secure and organized user experience.

## Core Features
1. **Role Creation**: Admin users can create new roles with specific permissions.
2. **Role Assignment**: Users can be assigned to one or more roles based on their needs and responsibilities.
3. **Role Permissions**: Each role can have specific permissions that dictate what actions users in that role can perform within the application.
4. **Role Management Interface**: A user-friendly interface for managing roles, including creating, updating, and deleting roles.

## Role Types

- **User**: Standard access to user-related features, such as uploading videos and managing their profiles.
- **Moderator**: Limited access to review and moderate user content.

## Implementation Details
### Role Creation
- The system allows administrators to create roles through the Role Management Interface. Roles can be created with specific permissions tailored to different job functions.
- After creating a role, it will be added to the system, and the admin can assign users to this role.

### Role Assignment

- Permissions are enforced through middleware that checks user roles before allowing access to specific routes or actions.

### Role Management Interface
