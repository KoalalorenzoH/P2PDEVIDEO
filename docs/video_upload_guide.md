# Video Upload Functionality Guide

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines on the video upload functionality within the P2PDEVIDEO application. The video upload feature allows users to securely upload videos to the decentralized network while ensuring data integrity and privacy through client-side encryption.

## Features
- **Client-Side Encryption**: Before uploading, videos are encrypted on the client side to protect user privacy.
- **Metadata Registration**: Metadata related to the video (such as title, description, and tags) is captured during the upload process.
- **Content Digest Generation**: A content digest (hash) is generated for each video to ensure data integrity during transmission.
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Uploaded videos are analyzed for content to provide intelligent recommendations to users.

## Prerequisites
To utilize the video upload feature, users must:
1. Be authenticated using the OAuth 2.0 protocol.
2. Have the necessary permissions to upload content.

## Upload Process
The following steps outline the video upload process:

1. **Select Video**: The user selects a video file from their device.
2. **Encryption**: The selected video is encrypted using AES-256 encryption before upload.
3. **Metadata Entry**: The user inputs relevant metadata, including video title, description, and tags.
4. **Upload**: The encrypted video, along with its metadata, is sent to the server for storage.
5. **Content Digest Generation**: A SHA-256 hash is generated for the uploaded content to ensure integrity.
6. **Completion Notification**: The user receives a notification upon successful upload.

## API Endpoint
The video upload functionality is accessed via the following API endpoint:
```
POST /api/video/upload
```
### Request Format
- **Headers**:
  - `Authorization: Bearer {token}`  
  - `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`

- **Body**:
  - `video`: (File) The video file to upload.
  - `metadata`: (JSON) The metadata object containing title, description, and tags.

### Example Request
```javascript
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('video', fileInput.files[0]);
formData.append('metadata', JSON.stringify({ title: 'My Video', description: 'A description', tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'] }));

fetch('/api/video/upload', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + accessToken,
    },
    body: formData,
}).then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```

## Error Handling
Ensure to handle possible errors during the upload process:
- **400 Bad Request**: The request is malformed or missing required fields.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The user is not authenticated or does not have permission to upload.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: An error occurred on the server during processing.

## Conclusion
This guide outlines the critical aspects of the video upload functionality in the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation of this feature enhances user engagement and supports a decentralized video sharing experience.

## Next Steps
For further development, consider reviewing the following aspects:
- Implement additional unit tests for the video upload feature.
- Enhance documentation on video metadata handling.
- Develop client-side validation for video uploads.
- Create integration tests for the video upload API endpoint.
- Implement user feedback mechanisms for upload success or failure notifications.
