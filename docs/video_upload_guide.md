# Video Upload Functionality Guide

## Overview
This document provides detailed information about the video upload functionality within the P2PDEVIDEO application. The video upload feature allows users to upload videos securely and efficiently, ensuring that the content is encrypted and properly managed.

## Key Features
- **Client-side Encryption:** Videos are encrypted on the client side before being sent to the server to ensure privacy and security.
- **Metadata Registration:** The system captures essential metadata during the upload process, including video title, description, and tags.
- **Content Digest Generation:** A unique content digest is generated for each uploaded video to ensure data integrity and facilitate intelligent recommendations.
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive error handling mechanisms are in place to provide feedback during the upload process.

## Upload Process
1. **User Authentication:** Ensure the user is authenticated before allowing video uploads. This can be done using OAuth 2.0 tokens.
2. **File Selection:** Users select a video file from their device.
3. **Client-side Encryption:** The selected video file is encrypted using AES-256 encryption before being sent to the server.
4. **API Call:** The encrypted video file is sent to the server via the video upload API endpoint. The API expects the following parameters:
   - `file`: The encrypted video file.
   - `title`: Title of the video.
   - `description`: Description of the video.
   - `tags`: Tags associated with the video.
5. **Server-side Processing:** The server processes the upload, registers the metadata, and generates a content digest.
6. **Response:** The server returns a success or error response to the client, indicating the status of the upload.

## API Endpoint
### POST /api/videos/upload
- **Request Body:**  
  ```json
  {
    "file": "<encrypted_video_file>",
    "title": "<video_title>",
    "description": "<video_description>",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
  }
  ```
- **Responses:**  
  - `200 OK`: Upload successful.  
  - `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request parameters.  
  - `401 Unauthorized`: User is not authenticated.  
  - `500 Internal Server Error`: Server encountered an error while processing the upload.

## Conclusion
This guide outlines the essential steps and considerations for implementing video upload functionality in the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation ensures that video uploads are secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
