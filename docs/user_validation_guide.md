# User Validation Guide

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the user validation features implemented in the P2PDEVIDEO project. User validation is essential for ensuring that the users of our decentralized encrypted peer-to-peer video network are properly authenticated and can access the necessary functionalities based on their permissions.

## Overview of User Validation

User validation involves checking the inputs provided by users during registration and profile updates to ensure they meet certain criteria. This helps maintain the integrity and security of user data in the system.

### Key Features of User Validation
1. **Registration Validation**: Validates user inputs during the registration process, including username, email, and password strength.
2. **Profile Update Validation**: Ensures that any updates to user profiles comply with validation rules.
3. **Role-based Validation**: Validates user actions based on their assigned roles and permissions.

## Registration Validation
During user registration, the following checks are performed:
- **Username**: Must be unique and meet a minimum character length.
- **Email**: Must be in a valid email format and not already in use.
- **Password**: Should meet complexity requirements (e.g., minimum length, inclusion of special characters).

### Example Validation Logic
```javascript
function validateRegistration(data) {
    const errors = {};

    if (!data.username || data.username.length < 3) {
        errors.username = "Username must be at least 3 characters long.";
    }
    if (!data.email || !isValidEmail(data.email)) {
        errors.email = "Email is invalid.";
    }
    if (!data.password || data.password.length < 6) {
        errors.password = "Password must be at least 6 characters long.";
    }

    return {
        isValid: Object.keys(errors).length === 0,
        errors
    };
}
```

## Profile Update Validation
When users update their profile information, it is crucial to validate the new data to prevent issues such as invalid email formats or duplicate usernames. Similar validation rules apply as in the registration process.

## Role-based Validation
Users have different roles (e.g., admin, viewer) which may dictate what actions they can perform. Role-based validation ensures that users only access features permitted by their assigned roles.

### Example Role-based Check
```javascript
function authorizeUserAction(user, action) {
    const permissions = getPermissionsForRole(user.role);
    return permissions.includes(action);
}
```

## Conclusion
User validation is a vital component of the P2PDEVIDEO application. Implementing robust validation checks helps protect user data and enhances the overall security of the platform.
