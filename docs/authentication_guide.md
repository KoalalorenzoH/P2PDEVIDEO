# Authentication Guide

This document provides an overview of the authentication mechanisms used in the P2PDEVIDEO project. Proper authentication is crucial for ensuring the security and privacy of users in the decentralized video sharing platform.

## Authentication Overview

In the P2PDEVIDEO project, we utilize OAuth 2.0 for user authentication. This allows users to securely log in to the platform using their existing credentials from third-party services (like Google or Facebook) or create a new account.

### Key Features of Our Authentication System:
- **Secure Login**: Users can log in using OAuth 2.0 or a standard email/password combination.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Different user roles (admin, user, guest) are defined to manage permissions and access levels within the application.
- **Multi-role Management**: Users can be assigned multiple roles, facilitating complex permission structures.
- **Anonymous Usage**: Users can access certain features without creating an account, ensuring privacy.

## OAuth 2.0 Authentication Flow

1. **User Initiates Login**: The user clicks on the "Login" button on the application.
2. **Redirect to Authorization Server**: The user is redirected to the OAuth 2.0 provider (e.g., Google).
3. **User Grants Permission**: The user grants the application permission to access their profile information.
4. **Receive Authorization Code**: The OAuth 2.0 provider redirects back to the application with an authorization code.
5. **Exchange Code for Token**: The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token and refresh token.
6. **Access Protected Resources**: The application uses the access token to access user data from the provider.

### Security Considerations

- **Token Expiry**: Access tokens are short-lived for security purposes. Refresh tokens can be used to obtain new access tokens without requiring the user to log in again.
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive user data is encrypted using AES-256 before storage.
- **Secure Communication**: All communication between the client and server is conducted over HTTPS.

## Conclusion

The authentication mechanisms implemented in P2PDEVIDEO provide a secure and flexible way for users to manage their accounts while ensuring compliance with industry-standard practices. For further inquiries or contributions, please refer to the project repository or contact the development team.
