# User Management Integration Tests

This document outlines the integration tests for the User Management system in the P2PDEVIDEO application. The User Management system includes user registration, authentication, profile management, and role management functionalities.

## Overview
Integration tests are essential for verifying that the various components of the User Management system work together as expected. These tests ensure that the API endpoints function correctly and that the expected data flows through the application.

## Key Functionalities to Test
1. **User Registration**: Test the registration process, including validation of input data and response status codes.
2. **User Login**: Validate the login process, ensuring that credentials are checked correctly and tokens are issued for authenticated users.
3. **Profile Management**: Verify that users can retrieve and update their profile information.
4. **Role Management**: Ensure that roles can be assigned and modified for users.

## Test Cases
### 1. User Registration
- **Test Case 1**: Valid registration data should return a success response.
  - **Input**: Valid username, password, and email.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 201 Created

- **Test Case 2**: Registration with existing username should return an error.
  - **Input**: Existing username.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 400 Bad Request

### 2. User Login
- **Test Case 1**: Valid credentials should return a token.
  - **Input**: Valid username and password.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 200 OK with token.

- **Test Case 2**: Invalid credentials should return an error.
  - **Input**: Invalid username or password.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 401 Unauthorized

### 3. Profile Management
- **Test Case 1**: Retrieve user profile should return the correct data.
  - **Input**: Valid user token.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 200 OK with user data.

- **Test Case 2**: Update user profile with valid data should succeed.
  - **Input**: Valid token and updated user data.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 200 OK

### 4. Role Management
- **Test Case 1**: Assign a role to a user should succeed.
  - **Input**: Valid user ID and role.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 200 OK

- **Test Case 2**: Attempt to assign an invalid role should return an error.
  - **Input**: Invalid role.
  - **Expected Output**: HTTP 400 Bad Request

## Running the Tests
To run the integration tests for the User Management system:
1. Ensure that the application is running.
2. Use the testing framework (e.g., Jest, Mocha) to execute the tests.
3. Review the results in the console output.

## Conclusion
Integration tests are critical for ensuring that the User Management functionalities of P2PDEVIDEO operate correctly when integrated with other components. This document serves as a guide for the implementation and execution of these tests.
