# User Role Management Integration Tests

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the integration tests of the User Role Management feature in the P2PDEVIDEO project. These tests ensure that the user role management functionalities work correctly when integrated with other system components such as authentication, authorization, user APIs, and database operations.

## Purpose

The integration tests validate the following aspects:

- Role creation, updating, retrieval, and deletion workflows.
- Proper enforcement of role-based access control (RBAC).
- Interaction with user entities and role assignments.
- Error handling and validation mechanisms.
- API endpoint correctness and middleware integration.

## Test Location

The integration tests are located in:

`tests/integration/userRoleIntegration.test.js`

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Role CRUD Operations
- Create a new role with valid attributes.
- Retrieve roles list and individual role details.
- Update role attributes and verify changes.
- Delete roles and ensure they are removed.
- Handle attempts to create duplicate roles or invalid data.

### 2. Role Assignment to Users
- Assign roles to users and verify the association.
- Remove roles from users and validate the update.
- Prevent assigning non-existent roles.

### 3. Access Control Enforcement
- Verify users with proper roles can access protected endpoints.
- Ensure users without required roles are denied access.
- Test middleware that enforces role-based permissions.

### 4. Validation and Error Handling
- Confirm validation errors are returned for invalid inputs.
- Test error responses for unauthorized access attempts.
- Verify system behavior on database failures or exceptions.

## Running the Tests

To run the user role management integration tests, execute the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/userRoleIntegration.test.js
```

Ensure the test environment is properly configured with access to the test database and any required environment variables.

## Dependencies

The integration tests depend on:

- User authentication and session management modules.
- User API endpoints.
- Role management API and controllers.
- Database connectivity and models.

## Best Practices

- Run these integration tests regularly during development to catch integration issues early.
- Maintain up-to-date tests as new role features or API changes are introduced.
- Use these tests as a reference for expected role management behaviors.
