# User Role Management Integration Tests

This document provides detailed information and guidelines about the integration tests for the User Role Management feature of the P2PDEVIDEO project.

## Overview

The User Role Management integration tests aim to verify the correct operation of the user role management APIs and controllers in a real-world scenario by testing end-to-end interactions involving multiple components.

These tests validate the following functionalities:

- Creating new user roles
- Retrieving existing user roles
- Updating user role details
- Deleting user roles
- Assigning roles to users and verifying role permissions
- Ensuring role-based access control enforcement

## Location of Tests

The primary integration test file for user role management is located at:

`tests/integration/userRoleManagementIntegration.test.js`

This file contains comprehensive test cases covering all the main user role management features.

## Test Scenarios Covered

1. **Role Creation**
   - Validates successful creation of new roles with required fields.
   - Handles attempts to create duplicate roles or invalid data.

2. **Role Retrieval**
   - Fetches all roles and individual roles by ID.
   - Handles non-existent role requests gracefully.

3. **Role Update**
   - Updates role properties such as name and permissions.
   - Validates input data and handles errors.

4. **Role Deletion**
   - Deletes roles and verifies they are no longer accessible.
   - Checks behavior when deleting roles assigned to users.

5. **Role Assignment to Users**
   - Assigns roles to users and verifies permissions.
   - Ensures users without appropriate roles are restricted.

6. **Access Control Enforcement**
   - Tests that APIs enforce role-based access control correctly.

## Running the Integration Tests

To run the user role management integration tests, use the following command in the project root:

```bash
npm run test:integration -- tests/integration/userRoleManagementIntegration.test.js
```

Ensure that the test environment is correctly set up with access to the test database and necessary environment variables.

## Best Practices for Writing Additional Tests

- Use descriptive test case names that clearly state the intended behavior.
- Handle setup and teardown of test data to keep tests isolated.
- Mock external dependencies where applicable.
- Aim for full coverage of both positive and negative scenarios.
- Validate responses thoroughly including status codes, response body, and side effects.
