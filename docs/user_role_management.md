# User Role Management Documentation

## Overview

User role management is a critical part of the P2PDEVIDEO application, allowing for the establishment of different user permissions and access levels. This documentation outlines the features, functionality, and usage of the user role management system. The user role management feature allows the application to define and manage different user roles within the P2PDEVIDEO platform, ensuring that users only have access to the resources and functionalities that they are permitted to use.

## Features

1. **Role Creation**: 
   - Admin users can create new roles with specific permissions.
   - Roles can include predefined permissions such as view, edit, delete, and manage users.

2. **Role Assignment**: 
   - Users can be assigned to one or multiple roles.
   - Role assignment can be done during user registration or modified later by an admin.
   - Allow administrators to assign roles to users when they register or through their profile management.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - The system implements RBAC to ensure users can only access features and data relevant to their roles.
   - Access to certain API routes and features will be restricted based on the assigned roles.
   - Implement functionality to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.

4. **Role Management**: 
   - Admin users can view a list of roles, modify existing roles, or delete roles that are no longer needed.
   - Updates to roles are logged for auditing purposes.

5. **Permission Management**: 
   - Permissions associated with roles can be modified at any time.
   - Changes in permissions reflect immediately in the user interface to ensure real-time access control.

## Role Definitions

1. **Admin**: Has full access to all features and settings in the application.
2. **User**: Standard role for regular users with access to core features like video uploads and viewing.
3. **Guest**: Limited access, primarily for users who are not logged in.

## Role-Based Access Control

### Middleware
A middleware will be implemented to check user roles before allowing access to certain routes. For example:
```javascript
const roleAuthorization = (roles) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        const userRole = req.user.role;
        if (!roles.includes(userRole)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
        }
        next();
    };
};
```

## Implementation Details

- **Data Model**: The user roles are stored in the MongoDB database, using a schema that defines the role name and associated permissions.
- **Role Management API**: Provide API endpoints for managing user roles programmatically.
- **API Endpoints**: The following API endpoints are provided for managing roles:
  - `GET /api/roles`: Retrieve all available roles.
  - `POST /api/roles`: Create a new role (Admin only).
  - `GET /api/roles/:id`: Retrieve a specific role by ID.
  - `PUT /api/roles/:id`: Update an existing role (Admin only).
  - `DELETE /api/roles/:id`: Delete a role (Admin only).
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions check user permissions before allowing access to certain routes, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create role management schema in the database.
2. Implement API endpoints for role management.
3. Develop middleware for role-based access control.
4. Create tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.

## Usage

- To create a new role, an admin would send a request to the `POST /api/roles` endpoint with the role details.
- Role assignments can be managed via the user management interface, allowing admins to easily add or remove roles from users.

## Next Steps

- Implement additional integration tests for user role management features.
- Develop documentation for permission management features.
- Create unit tests for user role management controller logic.

## Conclusion

User role management provides essential functionality for controlling access within the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation ensures that users have appropriate permissions while maintaining the security and integrity of the platform. This user role management feature is essential for ensuring a secure and organized user experience within the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation will enhance the overall functionality of the platform by allowing fine-grained access control based on user roles.
