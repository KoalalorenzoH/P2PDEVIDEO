# User Role Management Features

## Overview
User role management is a critical part of the P2PDEVIDEO application, allowing for the establishment of different user permissions and access levels. This documentation outlines the features, functionality, and usage of the user role management system.

## Features
1. **Role Creation**: 
   - Admin users can create new roles with specific permissions.
   - Roles can include predefined permissions such as view, edit, delete, and manage users.

2. **Role Assignment**: 
   - Users can be assigned to one or multiple roles.
   - Role assignment can be done during user registration or modified later by an admin.

3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: 
   - The system implements RBAC to ensure users can only access features and data relevant to their roles.
   - Access to certain API routes and features will be restricted based on the assigned roles.

4. **Role Management**: 
   - Admin users can view a list of roles, modify existing roles, or delete roles that are no longer needed.
   - Updates to roles are logged for auditing purposes.

5. **Permission Management**: 
   - Permissions associated with roles can be modified at any time.
   - Changes in permissions reflect immediately in the user interface to ensure real-time access control.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Model**: The user roles are stored in the MongoDB database, using a schema that defines the role name and associated permissions.
- **API Endpoints**: The following API endpoints are provided for managing roles:
  - `POST /api/roles`: Create a new role.
  - `GET /api/roles`: Retrieve all roles.
  - `PUT /api/roles/:id`: Update a specific role.
  - `DELETE /api/roles/:id`: Delete a specific role.
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions check user permissions before allowing access to certain routes, ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

## Usage
- To create a new role, an admin would send a request to the `POST /api/roles` endpoint with the role details.
- Role assignments can be managed via the user management interface, allowing admins to easily add or remove roles from users.

## Next Steps
- Implement additional integration tests for user role management features.
- Develop documentation for permission management features.
- Create unit tests for user role management controller logic.

## Conclusion
User role management provides essential functionality for controlling access within the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation ensures that users have appropriate permissions while maintaining the security and integrity of the platform.
