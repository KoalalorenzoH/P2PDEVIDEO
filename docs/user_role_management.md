# User Role Management Documentation

## Overview
User role management is an essential feature of the P2PDEVIDEO application that allows administrators to define and manage user roles, permissions, and access control. The system supports various roles such as admin, user, and guest, enabling flexible management of user capabilities.

## Core Features
- **Role Definition**: Create and manage roles within the application.
- **Permission Assignment**: Assign specific permissions to each role, controlling what users can do.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement security measures that restrict access based on user roles.
- **User Role Association**: Link users to specific roles, determining their access to certain resources and functionalities.

## API Endpoints
### Create Role
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/roles`
- **Description**: Create a new role in the system.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "roleName": "string",  // Name of the role
    "permissions": ["string"] // List of permissions for the role
  }
  ```

### Get Roles
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/roles`
- **Description**: Retrieve a list of all roles.

### Update Role
- **Endpoint**: `PUT /api/roles/:id`
- **Description**: Update an existing role.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "roleName": "string",
    "permissions": ["string"]
  }
  ```

### Delete Role
- **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/roles/:id`
- **Description**: Remove a role from the system.

### Assign Role to User
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/users/:userId/roles`
- **Description**: Assign a role to a specific user.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "roleId": "string"  // Role ID to assign
  }
  ```

## Implementation Details
1. **Data Model**: The role data model should include fields for role name and associated permissions.
2. **Middleware**: Use middleware for validating requests related to user roles.
3. **Testing**: Ensure to write unit and integration tests for role management functionalities to verify that the implementation meets the requirements.

## Conclusion
User role management is a critical component of the P2PDEVIDEO application, providing the necessary framework for controlling user access and permissions. Proper implementation and documentation of this feature ensure security and usability within the decentralized network.

## Next Steps
- Implement unit tests for user role management functionalities.
- Develop a user role management controller.
- Create integration tests for user role management API endpoints.
