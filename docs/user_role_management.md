# User Role Management Documentation

## Overview

The user role management feature allows the application to define and manage different user roles within the P2PDEVIDEO platform. This feature is crucial for implementing access control, ensuring that users only have access to the resources and functionalities that they are permitted to use.

## Features

- **Role Definitions**: Define multiple roles within the application such as Admin, User, and Guest.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement functionality to restrict access to certain parts of the application based on user roles.
- **Role Assignment**: Allow administrators to assign roles to users when they register or through their profile management.
- **Role Management API**: Provide API endpoints for managing user roles programmatically.

## Role Definitions

1. **Admin**: Has full access to all features and settings in the application.
2. **User**: Standard role for regular users with access to core features like video uploads and viewing.
3. **Guest**: Limited access, primarily for users who are not logged in.

## Role-Based Access Control

### Middleware
A middleware will be implemented to check user roles before allowing access to certain routes. For example:
```javascript
const roleAuthorization = (roles) => {
    return (req, res, next) => {
        const userRole = req.user.role;
        if (!roles.includes(userRole)) {
            return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
        }
        next();
    };
};
```

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/roles**: Retrieve all available roles.
- **POST /api/roles**: Create a new role (Admin only).
- **PUT /api/roles/:roleId**: Update an existing role (Admin only).
- **DELETE /api/roles/:roleId**: Delete a role (Admin only).

## Implementation Steps
1. Create role management schema in the database.
2. Implement API endpoints for role management.
3. Develop middleware for role-based access control.
4. Create tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.

## Conclusion

This user role management feature is essential for ensuring a secure and organized user experience within the P2PDEVIDEO application. Proper implementation will enhance the overall functionality of the platform by allowing fine-grained access control based on user roles.
